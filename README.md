## 🚀 What I Do

I build software that's **convenient, transparent, and actually enjoyable to use**. I focus on solving real problems—starting with my own—then making those solutions available for everyone.

**Current focus:** Building self-hosted alternatives to expensive SaaS, exploring gamification patterns, and contributing to open source. I do contract work for [Secton.org](https://secton.org), contribute to various projects, and work on tools that prioritize user control and transparency.

In 2025, I got into the Fyne conference with a Go project—proof that experimenting with new tech pays off. I'm strongest in PHP but actively expanding my React skills because branching out makes you better.

## 💭 Development Philosophy

**Human-Centered Design** — Your software should work how *you* work, not the other way around. I build with extensive customization and thoughtful details that add up to something meaningful.

**Convenience First** — When you focus on convenience, everything else falls into place. All those little features that tie everything together emerge naturally.

**Open & Transparent** — Self-hosted alternatives to expensive SaaS. You own your data. Open source by default because transparency builds trust.

**Always Learning** — Currently exploring gamification and human-focused interface design. The goal: software people actually *enjoy* using, not just tolerate.

**My Approach:** Laravel for speed and familiarity. React for modern UX. PostgreSQL for reliability. When something needs to be simple or niche, I drop back to plain PHP. I prefer TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind and Framer Motion for React projects, and I'm not afraid to write plain CSS when the situation calls for it.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started programming by following a YouTube tutorial to build a notepad app in C#. That curiosity turned into desktop development, then web development, and now I'm here—building tools I wish existed when I started.

Beyond code, I'm a **creative writer** (science fiction & speculative fiction), a **skier**, and a **gamer**. I believe that compliments, encouragement, and a human touch are what make great software stick.

**My Goal:** Make enough from my projects to go full open-source and focus entirely on building solutions to modern problems. Software that respects you, gives you control, and doesn't lock you into subscriptions you can't afford.

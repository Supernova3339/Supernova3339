## 🚀 What I Do

I build software that's **convenient, transparent, and actually enjoyable to use**. I focus on solving real problems—starting with my own—then making those solutions available for everyone.

**Current focus:** Building self-hosted alternatives to expensive SaaS, exploring gamification patterns, and contributing to open source. I do contract work for [Secton.org](https://secton.org), contribute to various projects, and work on tools that prioritize user control and transparency.

In 2025, I got into the Fyne conference with a Go project—proof that experimenting with new tech pays off. I'm strongest in PHP but actively expanding my React skills because branching out makes you better.

## 💭 Development Philosophy

**Human-Centered Design** — Your software should work how *you* work, not the other way around. I build with extensive customization and thoughtful details that add up to something meaningful.

**Convenience First** — When you focus on convenience, everything else falls into place. All those little features that tie everything together emerge naturally.

**Open & Transparent** — Self-hosted alternatives to expensive SaaS. You own your data. Open source by default because transparency builds trust.

**Always Learning** — Currently exploring gamification and human-focused interface design. The goal: software people actually *enjoy* using, not just tolerate.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

<div align="center">

### Languages & Frameworks
<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,ts,js,laravel,react,nextjs,html,css,tailwind,go" />

### Databases & Backend
<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=postgres,mysql,prisma,cloudflare" />

### Tools & Design
<img src="https://skills.syvixor.com/api/icons?perline=15&i=git,github,webstorm,phpstorm,penpot,docker" />

</div>

**My Approach:** Laravel for speed and familiarity. React for modern UX. PostgreSQL for reliability. When something needs to be simple or niche, I drop back to plain PHP. I prefer TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind and Framer Motion for React projects, and I'm not afraid to write plain CSS when the situation calls for it.

### Blogawr
**A plug-and-play blog solution for React**

Building a fully-featured alternative to Outstatic that's designed to be dropped into any React project. Focused on developer experience, flexibility, and keeping things simple.

🎯 **Goal:** Self-hosted, customizable, and developer focused. Full CLI, studio, and extremely easy to use. You wouldn't even need AI to understand how it works!

### GitStreak Embeddable Widget
**Profile widgets for your GitHub README**

Creating embeddable profile widgets for GitStreak that let you showcase your coding streak and stats directly in your README. Making streak tracking more visual and shareable.

🎯 **Goal:** Beautiful, customizable widgets that celebrate consistent coding habits.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started programming by following a YouTube tutorial to build a notepad app in C#. That curiosity turned into desktop development, then web development, and now I'm here—building tools I wish existed when I started.

Beyond code, I'm a **creative writer** (science fiction & speculative fiction), a **skier**, and a **gamer**. I believe that compliments, encouragement, and a human touch are what make great software stick.

**My Goal:** Make enough from my projects to go full open-source and focus entirely on building solutions to modern problems. Software that respects you, gives you control, and doesn't lock you into subscriptions you can't afford.
